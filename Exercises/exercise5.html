                    <!--What adjectives would you use to describe Bethany's portfolio-->
                    <li>Clean and direct</li>
                    <!--Describe the navigation: What pages are on the portfolio-->
                    <li>The navigation is very simple and uncluttered. On the left, there is a graphic that links you directly to a full-page spread of her work. On the right, there are three simple navs: About, Work, and Musings</li>
                    <!--Describe the design of the introductory information: What did you learn about Bethany?-->
                    <li>The About Me is short and sweet, with a nice dose of humor to make it enjoyable. She talks about her work and little else, keeping it professional, but still personal.</li>
                    <!--Describe the design and layout of the body content-->
                    <li>What's definitely designed to ensnare your attention the moment you arrive on the page is the heading. Big, bold, and colorful. It's made to stand out, and does a successful job of getting straight to the point about what this site is for and gives a little taste of the personality of the person behind it.</li>
                    <!--Describe the design of the footer: What's included?-->
                    <li>I really like the footer. In the left corner, there are graphic links to her Dribble, Instagram, and Twitter accounts. In the center is a graphic link to Nathanael Phillip, a developer and designer. In the right, is a custom watermark. Everything is grayed out so as not to draw attention away from the real focus of the page.</li>

                <h3>Mobile</h3>
                <ol>
                    <!-----------QUESTION 1------------>
                    <li>The graphic linking to her full-spread work page is the same, but the About, Work, and Musings links have moved under a "hamburger menu."</li>
                    <!-----------QUESTION 2------------>
                    <li>The size of the headline has adjusted to fit the screen, but remains bright and eye-catching.</li>
                    <!-----------QUESTION 3------------>
                    <li>The body text looks very much the same, but the two different sections have aligned up-and-down rather than side-by-side.</li>
                    <!-----------QUESTION 4------------>
                    <li>No longer a side-by-side layout, everything is single-columns and scrolls up-and-down.</li>
                    <!-----------QUESTION 5------------>
                    <li>The footer has also re-aligned to a single-column structure.</li>
                </ol>

            <!------SECOND ANALYSIS------>

                    <h2><a href="http://www.olivia.is/" target="_blank">Olivia Tytherleigh</a></h2>

                <section>
                    <h3>Desktop</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <!-------What adjectives would you use to describe Olivia’s portfolio?-------->
                        <li>Cool, smart, and long</li>
                        <!--Describe the layout & design of the introductory section. What have you learned about Olivia from this introduction?-->
                        <li>Very short. Just a brief summary of what she's been doing in the design world, and what she's currently up to. Not a fan of the typeface being used. Seems very bland.</li>
                        <!--Describe the layout & design of the portfolio entries. How does Olivia indicate that you’re about to see a new portfolio entries? How does Olivia lay out the project description? How does Olivia lay out the project images?-->
                        <li>This is a single-columns site. In order to view her work, you must scroll through all of it. Not a fan of this, mostly because there is a lot of content, which makes for a lot of scrolling. And the headings for each new section is not distinct enough from body text, and set too far to the left. I see very little hierarchy in this layout. The images are nice, though.</li>
                        <!--Describe the layout & design of the footer. What information Olivia include here?-->
                        <li>When you finally scroll to the end of the footer, you find it in the same design/scheme as the About Me at the top. Simple text links for Email, phone, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. They're off-set, not flush-left, but not centerd, but I believe that is because it's aligned with the placement of the first header. Which might be a good thing, if you could see the top from the bottom. But wait, you can't.</li>

                <section>
                    <h3>Mobile</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <!-----------QUESTION 1------------>
                        <li>The introductory section stands out more on it's own in the mobile layout. Text layout is much better and fits the screen in short, easy-to-read paragraphs. This extends throughout the page as you scroll.</li>
                        <!-----------QUESTION 2------------>
                        <li>This is still a single-column layout, but seeing it in Mobile form, I think that most of the effort went into how it would be presented on handheld devices. The individual portfolio sections are much clearer, and the images are no longer set up in a grid, but rather stacked, making it easier focus on the single image.</li>

                <header>
                    <h2><a href="http://danilocampos.com.br/" target="_blank">Danilo Campos</a></h2>
                    </header>
                    <section>
                    <h3>Desktop + Mobile</h3>
                        <ol>
                        <!---QUESTION 1--->
                        <li>The definition of simple. Some might even say under-done. The site looks like a single page of text set in a coding typeface. Black on white, pure and simple. You're first thought is to wonder if you're on the right page, or if it didn't load correctly.</li>
                        <!---QUESTION 2--->
                        <li>Hierarchy is established through placement. It's essentially how you expect things to be placed. Introductions come first, contact info is next, and then projects are listed to the right. Which is where all pretense of simplicity fades away. As you hover elements, things happen. Linked to his name is an image of himself. Appropriate. And paired with his list of projects are layouts of the work he's done. Very clever.</li>
                        <!--QUESTION 3-->
                        <li>In mobile view, everything is single-column, and you must tap on the links, which opens up all the information. Still cool, but closing the open link so you can view another was trickier to figure out.</li>
                        <!--QUESTION 4-->
                        <li>On Desktop view, the text is small and only takes up half the page. In mobile, the text is made to fit more of the screen, making it clear and easy to read.</li>
