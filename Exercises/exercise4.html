    <h1>Panda Bear Website Analysis</h1>
    <body>
        <ol>
        <!--Question 1-->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>For headers, this thick brush-stroke script is used, and serif typeface for the body copy. It's nice to look at, and seems to fit well with the context of the story being told on the website. But paired with the music of Panda Bear, I'm not sure I can say the same thing. There's a lot of electronic tones in his music. Computrized sound isn't very compatible with a script-like typeface. What I do like is that the display type isn't used only for headings but pull quotes as well, giving the site are more uniformed feel.</p>
        <!--Question 2-->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The blues and grays and greens used throughout the website are a little more fitting. He has kind of a wanderlust sound to his music which I think is represented well by the colors chosen.</p>
        <!--Quesiton 3-->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>As with the majority of these sites, the story is broken up by images and pull quotes.It looks nice, and makes the site interesting to scroll through, but the redundancy is a bit much. It's hard to say that the visuals of the site match the artist it was designed for when the same basic layout is used for all the different artists I've looked at. Same applies to question below.</p>
        <!--Question 4-->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>GIFs to give it motion and attempt making it more interesting, adding a little to that wanderlust feel. Display drop-caps are used at the beginning of each new section as well, making it more clear where they begin.</p>
