    <h1>Majical Cloudz Website Analysis</h1>
    <body>
        <p>I know, I know. You were expecting to find a website analysis here about the music group Majical Cloudz. Sorry to disappoint, but it's actually kind of a funny story. Not really, but I'll go ahead and explain.</p>
        <p>I completed exercise 2, did a beautiful job on it too, and lo and behold, before I could go into my GitHub desktop and sync it to my master file, a bit of on-the-side troubleshooting got in the way and my exercise was deleted! Whoops.</p>
        <p>What you're seeing is the bare minimum of what was NOT lost that terrible day.</p>
        <p>Hope you found that riveting.</p>
        <p>Have a great day!</p>
