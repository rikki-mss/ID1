                    <strong>What adjectives would you use to describe the design of this site?</strong>

                <li><strong>Describe how the navigation for this “story” works.</strong>
                    <br>The navigation is pretty simple. You click on chapter one, scroll through it, and at the bottom there is a button/link to take you to the next chapter.</li>
                <!--QUESTION THREE-->
                <li><strong>How does the ending for Chapter 3 differ from the endings for the other 2 chapters?</strong>
                    <br>Chapter 3 is the hope chapter. And it's where they make their case and try to garner a reaction from the reader that will <em>inspire</em> them to donate and help the cause.
                </li>
                <!--QUESTION 4-->

                    <br>I think they hoped to garner enough sympathy so that awareness would spread and people would join their cause and give money.</li>

            <h2>Stumptown Coffee</h2>

                <!--QUESTION ONE-->
                <li><strong>What adjectives would you use to describe the design of this site?</strong>
                    <br>Charming and bold.</li>
                <!--QUESTION TWO-->
                <li><strong>Describe how the navigation for this site works.</strong>
                    <br>Navigation is provided through graphics and banners.</li>
                <!--QUESTION THREE-->
                <li><strong>Describe the product pages. What information about the product did the creators include? How would you describe the visual hierarchy? Do you think the elements on the page are cohesively designed? Why or why not?</strong>
                    <br>The information provided is pretty basic. A picture, showing the packaging of the product. The name of that product. And the price.</li>
                <!--QUESTION 4-->
                <li><strong>What do you think the creators of this site hoped to accomplish?</strong>
                    <br>They wish to entice you to buy their products.</li>

            <h2>Elizabeth River Trail</h2></section>
        <ol>
            <!--QUESTION ONE-->
            <li><strong>What adjectives would you use to describe the design of this site?</strong>
                <br>Clean, modern, and fun.</li>
            <!--QUESTION TWO-->
            <li><strong>Describe how the navigation works. What pages are in the navigation? Do you ever feel lost while browsing the site? Why or why not?
                </strong>
                <br>The navigation is fixed and made up of an Explore page, History page, and Future page. In Explore, you're basically taken on a virtual tour of the Elizabeth River Trail. In History, it's pretty much what you expect it to be: the history of the trail. For the Future page, it's not as straightforward, as they don't only use this as a means to explain their hopes and dreams, but ask for aid in achieving them.</li>
            <!--QUESTION THREE-->
            <li><strong>Do the page names in the navigation seem appropriate for the content on these pages?</strong>
            <br>I think so.</li>
            <!--QUESTION 4-->
            <li><strong>What do you think the creators of this site hoped to accomplish?</strong>
            <br>The purpose of this website seems to be to inform and excite. They want to get people interested in what the Elizabeth River Trail has to offer, which is the first step in accomplishing those lofty hopes and dreams.</li>
