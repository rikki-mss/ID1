        <h1>State of the World</h1>
        <p>I love the variety. I love that not everything is exactly the same, even though similarities abound across the globe. From beaches to mountains, from deserts to forests, from birds to fish, there is so much to explore in this world. And it extends beyond nature. There may not be anything more vast in its differences as humanity. As predictable as we can be, as many things as one person might have in common with another, not one of us is an exact copy of another. We are unique. We are individual. And it's a very beautiful thing.</p>
        <p>I hate the entitlement. How so many people in the world today seem to think that they are somehow the singlemost important thing in the universe. I would never consider someone to be worthless. We all have purpose, and all have immense value. But to take that to mean that you should always be treated in a certain way, that your opinion is the most important, and you trample over everyone else in your desire to have only what you want, regardless of the lives around you, that is a gross error in human-thinking these days.</p>
        <p>If I answered this truthfully, it would be a book. So, I'll stick with the most elusive thing of all: I would have world peace.</p>
