    <!--Question 1-->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The very first typeface used for Machines for Life instantly struck me as unsuitable. The very word <em>machines</em> kinda demands a typeface that isn't some brush-stroke script. Aside from that, the typefaces used throughout the webpage do a better job of representing a machine and techno vibe. Except maybe the body copy typeface, which is surprisingly a serif typeface. Usually when dealing with futuristic material, san-serif typefaces are preferred. The typeface used for pull quotes is the most accurate representation of the band's music.</p>
    <!--Question 2 -->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>I think the colors for the webpage work nicely. Clean enough to give you a robotic feel without being totally droll. Some areas as you scroll through and the color shifts are a little problematic in that it lowers the contrast of the text on the page, making it momentarily harder to read. The color in the images help liven up the page where it's otherwise a basic black on white setup.</p>
    <!--Question 3-->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>As mentioned, the images help keep the webpage alive. They also breakup the story to keep it from feeling too long and sometimes take up the page and are paired with a pull-quote. They're laid out well, not nearly as chaotic as some image layouts on these websites.</p>
    <!--Question 4-->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>Images paired with pull-quotes that run across the page as you scroll separate the different sections.</p>
