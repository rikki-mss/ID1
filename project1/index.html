        <h1>My Favorite Musical Artist</h1>
        <p>For the last ten years of my life, give or take, there has been one band that I always go back to, that I listen to when I’m in serious need of a pick-me-up, or just need to feel sane. That band is Relient K. I couldn’t tell you the year or month, but I still remember that first time I heard their song “Who I Am Hates Who I’ve Been” playing from the TV where I’d left it on a radio station while I did my homework. As the lyrics penetrated my concentration, I remember setting aside my notebook and pen, getting up and coming closer, turning the volume up, and listening so, so closely:</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">“’Cause I don’t want you to know where I am
            <br>‘Cause then you’ll see my heart in the saddest state it’s ever been
            <br>And this is no place to try and live my life…
            <br>Stop right there, that's exactly where I lost it
            <br>See that line, well I never should have crossed it
            <br>Stop right there, well I never should have said 
            <br>That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back…”</p>
        <p>After just going through a trial my teenage self truly saw as tragic, these lyrics struck a chord deep inside, stripping me bare and helping me realize that maybe I wasn’t the only one who had experienced such a tantamount level of shame. And it was the moment Relient K became the source of immense comfort and understanding throughout the years to come.</p>
        <p>From Canton, OH, the band Relient K was formed by Matthew Thiessen, Matthew Hoopes, and Brian Pittman in the year 1998. Though commonly associated with Christian rock/punk, their success has really been founded in the mainstream and alternative genres. Pittman left the band in 2004. John Warne joined that same year and in 2007, drummer Ethan Luck joined the band and both remained until 2013. John Schneck joined in 2005 as a rhythm guitarist and left in 2015. Today the band mostly consists of two members: Thiessen (vocals, guitar, piano) and Hoopes (vocals, guitars). They released their 8th studio album, <i>Air for Free</i>, on July 22, 2016, which debuted at No. 44 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 (Wikipedia). There is a statement on the band’s Facebook page of their desire to make “fresh” music. I think they have accomplished exactly that. Their music ranges anywhere from rock to punk to alternative flawlessly.</p>
        <p>To a girl who grew up listening to Gospel and, sadly, Bluegrass, falling in love with Relient K’s music was a big step in learning my own musical tastes and preferences. Though my parents rarely listened along with me, they never faulted me for my choice. I went crazy over Relient K, but I wasn’t a fangirl. I didn’t have multiple posters of them all over my walls or know the complete backstory of every single band member. I didn’t even know they started in Ohio until last year. My love for this particular band went deeper. It wasn’t even their <em>music</em> per se, that drew me to them in the first place. It was their <em>lyrics</em>. But don’t take that to mean I don’t love their sound. I don’t find anything to dislike, and I greatly enjoy their variety of tunes and moods. However, at the heart of my never-ending love for Relient K, is my appreciation for their lyrics and how they consistently pair those good words with fresh, catchy tunes.</p>
        <p>Like a lot of teenagers in the world, I had my share of debilitating demons growing up. But unlike a lot of teenagers, I didn’t make friends I could share those demons with and still feel safe. Being a military kid, we moved a lot when I was younger, but either way, I never made friends easily. I was bullied at school, bullied at church, so I stuck to myself. A lot. Music, obviously, was a major outlet, as it is for many people. There were a bunch of artists I listened to, but when I found Relient K…I had never felt so <em>understood</em>. Matthew Thiessen, the band’s lead singer, writes their songs. There were moments of madness when I wondered if Thiessen somehow knew <em>about me</em>, if he was actually writing these songs about me. Of course it wasn’t true, but at times it felt like it could be. It was because of Relient K’s songs that I was able to face some of those demons.</p>
        <p>Today, I’m not as emotionally unstable as my 13-year-old self, but Relient K continues to impact me with their music. In my hand-me-down minivan, one of the few CDs I still carry with me is their 2007 album <i>Five Score and Seven Years Ago</i>. It is in surprisingly good condition after 10 years, especially with my relentless playing, and temporary possession by my brother and a friend. Without a doubt, it is my favorite album ever made. The songs are so powerful, and relevant to me even today. When in life I reach a moment where I have no idea what I’m doing, or I doubt who I am, and I’m on the verge of literal panic, I listen to that album. Then I listen to all the Relient K albums I own. To be frank and perfectly dramatic, their music is usually what keeps me sane. Even in not-so-harrowing moments, especially now, I like listening to the songs that meant so much to me as a teenager and seeing how far I’ve come since then.</p>
        <p>The hardest question to answer in regards to Relient K is what my favorite song is. Cliché, I know, but it is so hard to choose. Do I pick the one I’ve loved for the longest? The eleven I listen to the most? Or the six that speak to me every time I hear them? A nearly impossible task to choose between them and select one to talk about. So after much deliberation, and not a little back and forth, I believe I’ve chosen the song that is not only a favorite, but it might be the most encouraging song they’ve ever recorded. It’s called “Up and Up.” What I like so much about this song, as I do with the majority of their songs, is that amidst catchy music and an up-beat tempo, the lyrics are truly inspiring. More than inspiring, they <em>mean</em> something. They are relatable, and when I listen to it, I feel encouraged. I feel hope. This is one of those times when I listen and I can’t help but think “Is this somehow about me?” So long as Relient K releases songs that can make me want to ask that question, they will remain my number one. As of July 2016, they did have me wondering with at least five songs off of Air for Free, so my love for them goes on. Outside of those especially relatable tracks though, I still find Relient K to be my favorite in lyrics, sounds, and overall talent.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, Relient K wormed their way into my heart with their “head-banging” music and powerful lyrics. Today, it is very much the same. Out of all the head-banging bands I used to listen to, Relient K is the only one I still listen to regularly. The impression they have on me is not something in the past, it is still happening. “Who I Am Hates Who I’ve Been” is still <em>that</em> song I listen to when I feel shameful. “Up and Up” is what I listen to when I need encouragement. I listen to their song “Come Right Out and Say It” when I am feeling frustrated. I blasted “Bummin’” from their latest album all summer long, especially when I was feeling down. I could go on and on about all the ways and all songs of Relient K that have made an impact in my life and made me better. What drew me to them in the first place is what draws me today. That’s why Relient K is my favorite musical artist.</p>
