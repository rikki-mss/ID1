            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <section id="about">
                <p>Well, for starters, my name is Rikki Price. No, "Rikki" is not my <em>real</em> name, but it is what I prefer so, please, do not ask for my given name. If you already know what it is, please, keep it to yourself and we'll get along fine. Thanks!</p>
                <p>Now that that's out of the way, we can focus on the actual purpose of this virtual introduction. How did I end up on a path to become a graphic designer? The easiest answer is "I don't have a clue." But that doesn't make for a very interesting article, so let's get a little more detailed, shall we? And I do <em>kinda</em> have a clue, it's just a bit embarrassing, so how do I put that into words without having people look at me like I'm...you know what, how about I just stay on topic, okay? This'll go much faster.</p>
                <p>I guess the simplest answer to the question stated above is: movies. Particularly animated ones. No, I am not going to tell you what I watch and what my favorites are. Although, if you spend any amount of time with me, you're bound to find out at some point not too far in the future. But, again, I'm trying to stay on topic. So, I got over my teenage-induced belief over what's cool and what's not about, eh, 6 years ago, and started watching animated movies again. With this occurence, I became a wee bit obsessed in observing every freaking element of the movie that broke me into this stunning new pastime. I started to wonder how they did it, marveling at the time and effort and endless creativity all bundled up to make wonderful stories come alive. As a result, I got it into my head that I wanted to be an animator. But as luck would have it, I can't draw squat. Healthy alternative? Become a graphic designer and keep dreaming that <em>someday</em> I might actually have an inkling of talent that can be used toward animation, or movie-making in general. TV would be great, too. I'm not picky.</p>
