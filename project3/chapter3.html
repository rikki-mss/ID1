        <h3>Chapter Three: The Paths I Choose</h3>
        <p>How do stories come to me? Where do I find inspiration? How do I push myself to finish what I've started? And what does come first: the world, the characters, or the story?</p>
        <p>Out of nowhere. That's one way a story might reveal itself. Or maybe it begins from a kernal of thought sparked by another story I've recently read. Often, for me, they begin with the characters. The hero or heroine. They drive the story don't they? Once I know who my characters are, the rest of the story falls into place. Usually, the process begins on paper. A notebook, pens, and scraps to scribble <em>useless</em> information.</p>
        <p>I find myself staring at a blank page, a blank screen, my head a muddle of scattered thoughts and scurrying ideas, moving too fast for me to latch onto a single one. When in this position, long walks and music are usually the help I need.</p>
