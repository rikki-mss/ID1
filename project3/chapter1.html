            <p>Chapter One: Where I Go
                Okay. This is it. I have a story to tell, and I’m going to tell it. But where do I start? A difficult question to answer. I suppose, though, that one of the most important things to know is where I am going.</p>
            <p>Where should I go? Where can I go? There are no limits here, within my imagination. Some people like bustling cityscapes. Some like peaceful countrysides. Or maybe something in between. I know plenty of people who are comfortable right where they are, on this third planet from the sun. Personally, while this world does have its perks, it is not where I want to be. It’s not where my imagination longs to take me.</p>
            <p>What do I see? Oh, I don’t know. There’s almost too much to tell. A dark, isolated country, hidden from the sun underneath layers upon layers of stormy gray clouds, almost always full of rain or snow. I see this country is overwhelmed by mountains. So many mountains, you would wonder how anyone could live there at all. Some dark and green with dense forests, others bald and grey with unforgiving stone, or cold and white with never-melting snow. Forsaken kingdoms scattered throughout its rocky and forested terrain. One kingdom intact, the newest, founded by a brave and wise queen. A long, winding river stretches from the western coast to the heart of this kingdom, bringing ships to trade.</p>
            <p>Where else? There. Another country, the northern-most of a large continent, bathed in nothing but ice, snow, and cold wind. Its people are hardy and stubborn. They’ve endured more than harsh winters. War. So much war, but they remain. Eleven kingdoms divide it, but despite the wars of the past, currently strive to work together. Chieftains rule the territories, with one king to guide them all. This country is as diverse as it is vast, harboring people of all backgrounds, and home to assassins and heroes alike. And there are monsters. Monsters to fear, though none are feared more than those that fly: dragons.</p>
            <p>There’s more. A quiet, wooded land awash in colors of everlasting autumn. An island glaring with abundant sunlight, and dark turquoise waters just as warm.</p>
            <p>So many possibilities. So many outcomes. Where will I go? How do I choose? How do I prepare?
                I use this.</p></section>
