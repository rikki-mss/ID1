            <h3>Chapter Two: Who I Meet</h3>
            <p>Okay. Worlds done. Now I'm left to wonder who will be there, who will drive this story farther and faster than I could alone. I have to think about this, long and hard, but that's okay. I love this part. Meeting these characters.</p>
            <p>It takes time. I know that the characters I start with may not be the ones I end with. Some that weren't expected to have an impact end up being the thread that ties everything else together. And what do I find first? Names? Characteristics? I know it changes. There's no sure way of determining just how I come to know these vital players of my story. But I should attempt to show something. Where should I start?</p>
            <p>I'll start with that first world, since these characters are shaped by the world they live in, as much as they will give me new insight into the world I've chosen to set my story. The isolated country. Dark skies. High-reaching mountains. Who's there?</p>
            <p>I see a king. Young and passionate, yet heavy-burdened with great responsibility. He lives in that intact kingdom, the son of the brave and wise queen who founded it. He has two friends. A general and a historian. The three have grown up together, worked together, fought together. One will betray the young king. But that's venturing into plot, not character. What else do I need to know?</p>
            <p>I guess I could look here.</p></section>
