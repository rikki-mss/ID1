        <section id="worldtalk">
            <p>One of the most exciting parts of planning and developing your story if deciding where it takes place. If you're a fantasy maniac like me, world-building can be a ton of fun. Obviously, the kind of fiction you're writing is what determines the world. And the best thing to do is always stick with what you're comfortable with. If the real world is where you're most comfortable, stay there. Just don't be afraid to take chances.</p>
            <p>Your characters should be molded by the world they're in, so knowing as much as possible about that world is crucial. A world that <em>pops</em> off the page can really draw people in, and following characters as they scope the depths of the world provided is a big part of the adventure.</p>
