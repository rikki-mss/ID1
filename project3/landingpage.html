            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>As an aspiring writer who sometimes can have a rather difficult time getting my big ideas onto a page, I decided to create this site to aid any other writers out there who struggle. Maybe you've never written anything before, and you don't know where to begin with the story running through your head. Maybe you've started what you hope will be your masterpiece, but have gotten stuck and don't know what to do now. I am not an expert of any kind, but I have been where you've been. My goal here is simply to...help. Or at the very least provide some amusement until you gain momentum.</p>
            <p>This will only make sense to a few. This will only be useful to a few. I'm giving fellow writers a glimpse into my psyche. It is weird and messy and so I give you fair warning before venturing farther.</p>
            <p>But to help you along, I've divided said Psyche into chapters. In these chapters, I'll be discussing-in my own unique writer's way-how i develop my stories. Have fun exploring.</p>
