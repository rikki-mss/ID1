        <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>As an aspiring writer who somethimes can have a rather difficult time getting my big ideas onto a page, I decided to create this site to aid any other writer's out there who struggle. Maybe you've never written anything before, and you don't know where to begin with the story running through your head. Maybe you've started what you hope will be your masterpiece, but have gotten stuck and don't know what to do now. I am not an expert of any kind, but I have been where you've been. My goal here is simply to...help. Or at the very least provide some amusement until you gain momentum.</p>
